# The Root of Everything
Clicking on the first lowercase link in the main text of a Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, usually eventually gets one to the Philosophy article. As of May 26, 2011, 94.52% of all articles in Wikipedia lead eventually to the article Philosophy.

This program uses Beautiful Soup JS (https://github.com/maligndrome/Beautiful-Soup-JS) to check random pages and how many first link clicks it takes to get to the root of everything, 'Philosophy'.
